    For Example - If you have 1 main site with 3 subsites. Then, you have to configure the plugin 3 times on each site as well as 3 service provider configurations in your IDP. Instead, with multisite premium plugin. You have to configure the plugin only once on main network site as well as only 1 service provider configuration in the IDP.

You can give access to users by users to IDP mapping (which IDP to use to authenticate a user) is done based on the domain name in the user's email.
