== Description ==

**Important ✋**: beginning with version 1.5.3, we don't support anymore native iOS app. This is a tough choice [we explain here](https://uncategorized-creations.com/4550/dropping-ios-support-%F0%9F%98%B1/).

**Progressive web apps**: support for progressive web applications (PWA) has been added to 1.5x release. PWA are a new way to deliver fast, reliable and great experience on the web notably for mobiles. They allow to create apps accessible as websites that you can install and access as traditionnal mobile apps.

A great way to build progressive web apps (PWA) and mobile apps for your WordPress site using your favorite technologies: JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Progressive web apps (PWA) and mobile applications are a great way to offer an outstanding mobile experience for your users. Using push notifications, letting users read offline, using saved accounts to share content are among many wonderful things you can do with mobile applications.

= The Toolkit You Need to Build Your App =

* **Native support of WordPress**: custom post types, custom fields, custom taxonomies, comments, secured authentication
* **Full support of progressive web apps (PWA)**
* **Android support**
* **PhoneGap/Cordova**: use JavaScript, HTML and CSS to build apps
* **PhoneGap Build**: Easy online compilation
* **Themes**: create app themes
* **Customizable**: hook into our API to add the features you need

= Getting Started =

Even if you are familiar with development, building your first PWA or mobile app can be intimidating. We know that, we’ve been there before :-)

For that, we have tutorials and documentation that will guide you through the process:
* to create your first PWA
* to have your first app connected to your WordPress site installed on your phone.

= App Themes: a Flexible Way To Build Apps =

WP-AppKit supports JavaScript based PWA and app themes. We provide 2 default sister themes named *Q for iOS* and *Q for Android*. These themes are installed with the plugin. You can  also develop your own themes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

You'll find [an always up to date FAQ](https://goo.gl/cgQWyA) on our website.

= How do I install WP-AppKit? =

Like any other WordPress plugin, install the plugin through the WordPress `Plugins` screen directly (or upload plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-appkit` directory), then activate it through the `Plugins` screen in WordPress and click the `WP-AppKit` menu entry to start creating your app!

**Note:** WP-AppKit uses a special folder called `themes-wp-appkit` to store the app themes. This folder is automatically created in `/wp-content` at plugin installation.

**Github version:** if you have the [github version of WP-AppKit](https://github.com/uncatcrea/wp-appkit) already installed on your WordPress, please **unsintall** it and **delete** the `/plugins/wp-appkit` folder before installing the version from WordPress.org's plugin repository.
Your current WP-AppKit apps and themes (in `wp-content/themes-wp-appkit`) won't be affected by this operation.

= How many applications can I create? =

You can create an **unlimited** number of applications and an unlimited number of versions of each application. That includes native apps as well as progressive web apps.

= Can I send push notifications? =

**Yes.** It is not implemented by default. We recommend that you use a service such as OneSignal to implement push notifications for your app.

= Do you support Custom Fields? =

**Yes.** By default, we don’t send Custom Fields to apps (to avoid performance issues). However, you can easily add the custom fields you need. By the way we have [a nice tutorial](https://uncategorized-creations.com/1712/display-wordpress-custom-fields-app/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=plugin_readme) about that. You can also use [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/).

= Do you support WordPress comments? =

**Yes.** You can display WordPress comments (including threaded comments). However, posting comments requires development.

= Do you use the WP REST API? =

We use a homemade (extendable) REST API. As the WP REST API is now integrated to WordPress core, we’ll probably rely on it in the future.

= Is WP-AppKit compatible with WooCommerce? =

You can display WooCommerce content (ie. products) in your themes as any other WordPress content. However, you’ll have to (re)develop functionalities such as cart or checkout.

= Do you compile native applications for me? =

**No.** You can use PhoneGap Build, an easy to use Adobe’s cloud compilation service or the classic Cordova CLI.

= Do you deploy progressive web apps for me? =

**Yes.** Progressive web apps are not distributed through app stores. They are freely available on the web. WP-AppKit allows to deploy and update PWA on your site.

= Do you release native applications in app stores for me? =

**No.** This is something you’ll have to do by yourself when your application is ready and compiled.
