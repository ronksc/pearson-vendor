To play online games, what Leo actually gives up is only swimming, i.e., the second priority.

Based on his preferences, Leo ranks the three options as follows: This is not difficult to understand. Suppose Leo did not play online games. He cannot choose to do all of the other things at the same time. He can only choose one of the remaining options. As swimming can give him a higher value (also the ‘highest’ value) among the two remaining options, he will choose to swim. In other words, if Leo chooses to play online games, he only gives up swimming. Leo Demand and Supply 8 Teaching notes: • Since a person cannot choose all the alternatives, he does not forgo all of them. Among all the alternatives, only the highest–valued one is relevant in decision–making: if he is to choose among these forgone alternatives, he will pick the alternative with the highest value. This is the only one he sacrices in making a choice. Therefore, only the highest–valued option forgone constitutes the cost of an option and is relevant for decision–making. • Leo’s decision about spending an afternoon involves cost. This is because he can only do one of the activities and so he needs to make a choice. If he can do all the things described during the afternoon, he would not need to make a choice and no cost would be involved.","@ID":8},{"#text":"Task 1.1 1.1 What is economics? Economics is a social science. It studies human behaviour using scientific methods. Economists develop economic theories to explain and predict human behaviour. Do you know what economics means? How is your daily life related to economics? As a beginner, you may not have any ideas about these questions, but you will after studying this course. In this chapter, we will first study some basic concepts in economics. In the next chapter, we will study how economic problems are tackled in our daily lives. To begin with … Demand and Supply 2 1. Why are you studying economics? 2. What do you associate economics with when you think about it? Why are you studying economics? It teaches me how to earn a lot of money. It’s an interesting subject. It can teach me how to use my money wisely. It can help pave my future career path in the business and financial sectors. Teaching notes: Economics does not teach students how to earn a lot of money. However, if students realise the importance of using their time e  ciently, they may be able to earn a lot of money in the future. Free answer. Free answer. Teaching notes: Students may associate economics with some general economic phenomena like unemployment, in ation and the problem of poverty. Teachers may write down the phenomena students have suggested, and explain whether those phenomena are related to microeconomics or macroeconomics later.","@ID":2},{"#text":"What is economics? To conclude,  only the highest-valued option forgone is regarded as the opportunity cost of making a choice. Other options (i.e., the third priority, fourth priority, etc.) are not part of the cost when making a choice. They are therefore irrelevant in decision-making. C Under what situations will opportunity cost change? Now, we have learned the meaning of opportunity cost. Let’s think about the situation when cost changes. Discuss with your classmates the following cases (provided that Leo chooses to play online games). If you think there is a change in cost, put a ‘ ✓ ’ in the box provided and explain how it changes. i. The value of playing online games increases. ii. The value of swimming decreases but it is still Leo’s second priority. iii. The value of playing basketball increases and it replaces swimming to become Leo’s second priority. 1. Change in the value of the chosen option will not affect the cost Changes in the value of the chosen option affect the value received, but not the cost of choosing it. If Leo finds playing online games boring, the cost of playing online games does not change. The highest-valued option forgone is still swimming. The only change for Leo is the value of playing online games (see Table 1.2). Table 1.2 Even if the value of playing online games decreases, Leo’s cost of playing online games is still swimming. 1st priority Playing online games 2nd priority Swimming 3rd priority Playing basketball Chosen option Highest-valued option forgone Value Refer to Table 1.2. If the chosen option is not the 1st priority option, the opportunity cost of choosing that option must be the 1st priority option. 1 9 ✓ ✓ Teaching notes: i.  It will not aect the value of the highest–valued option forgone ii.  The cost will decrease as the value of swimming (the highest–valued option forgone) decreases. iii.  The cost will increase as playing basketball becomes the highest–valued option forgone and has a higher value than swimming (the original second priority). Teaching notes: Students may be asked what would happen to the opportunity cost for Leo in choosing to play online games if the value of playing online games becomes lower than the value of another option (e.g., swimming). Students should be able to answer that the opportunity cost is still swimming. Then, students can be reminded that Leo would choose swimming under such circumstances, given that he is rational.","@ID":9},{"#text":"2. The cost will change only if there is a change in the highest-valued option forgone or its value Case 1: Change in the value of the highest-valued option forgone The cost will change if there is a change in the value of the highest-valued option forgone. For example, if the weather is hot and Leo gains greater pleasure from swimming, the cost of playing online games will increase.

Remark: Resources can be used to produce goods and services. Goods and services can be used to satisfy wants. Goods are tangible3 (e.g., clothing), while services are intangible (e.g., transport).

Resource allocation : This concerns how limited resources are allocated for the production of different goods and services. 2. Distribution of goods and services : This is also regarded as income distribution . This concerns how goods and services are distributed among different people. In addition, we classify the study of economics into microeconomics4 and macroeconomics. 5 A Microeconomics Microeconomics is the study of the behaviour of individual economic units (e.g., households6 and firms7 ). In microeconomics, we study how households make consumption8 decisions, how firms make production9 decisions, and how the interactions10 between firms and households determine the allocation of resources and distribution of income. We will discuss microeconomics from Book 1 to Book 4. B Macroeconomics Macroeconomics is the study of the performance of an economy as a whole. In macroeconomics, we focus on the overall performance of the whole economy. We study the measurement and determinants11 of major economic indicators, such as total production, employment and the price level. We also study government policies that improve the overall performance of the economy. We will discuss macroeconomics from Book 5 to Book 7. 1 3","@ID":3},{"#text":"What is economics? 1 scarcity稀少性 / 缺乏 2 choices選擇 3 material物質的 4 competition競爭 1.2 Wants, scarcity and choice ‘Task 1.2’ above concerns three basic concepts in economics. They are wants, scarcity1 and choices. 2 The following explains what they mean and how they are related. A Wants Wants are human desires for things. Refer to ‘Task 1.2’. Jody wants her father’s love, a smartphone and a tablet computer. This illustrates that wants can be material3 (e.g., water and food) or non-material (e.g., love, care and sense of achievement). Wants are unlimited and can never be fully satisfied. When a particular want has been satisfied, new wants will emerge.  Therefore, Jody would have other wants even her father could fulfil all of the things she asked for. Note Wants are human desires for things. Wants are unlimited. Fig. 1.2 Wants are unlimited. B Scarcity All people have limited resources to satisfy their unlimited wants. Similarly, Jody’s father does not have enough time and money to satisfy his and his daughter’s wants. Every person, whether rich or poor, faces the problem of scarcity . Scarcity is the problem that arises when we want more than what we have. As a result, people engage in competition4 to obtain more resources or goods. In addition, they have to make choicesto better utilise the scarce resources or goods that they have. 1 5 Reminder The concept of competition will be discussed in the next chapter. Teaching notes: Economics is sometimes called the study of scarcity as scarcity is the most important assumption in economics. If there is no scarcity, people would not be concerned about resource allocation and output distribution.","@ID":5},{"#text":"1 rational理性的 Test yourself 1.1 If Jody’s father is a billionaire, would he and Jody still face the problem of scarcity? 1.2 ‘Because of scarcity, we have to make choices,’ said Student A. ‘Even without scarcity, we still have to make choices,’ said Student B. Which one is right? 1.3 Explain if the following statements are true, false or uncertain. a. Economics is the study of how to get rich. b. Economics is the study of how to eliminate the problem of scarcity. c. Economics is the study of how to get most out of the limited resources we have. C Choice Because of scarcity, every person has to make choices to decide what wants to satisfy and what wants to give up. Every person, family, firm and government has to make choices about how to make use of the scarce resources they have. If we are rational, 1 we will choose the option that we value the most. As in the previous case,  Jody would choose a smartphone if she wants it more than a tablet computer. Whether a resource (or a good) is scarce or not depends on its relative quantity rather than its absolute quantity. Regardless of the quantity of the resource, as long as its quantity available is smaller than its quantity desired, it is scarce. Hence, scarcity is a relative concept. Scarcity is a relative concept 1.1 Learning tips Demand and Supply 6 Teaching notes: Scarcity means that limited resources cannot be used to satisfy unlimited wants. Yes, they still face the problem of scarcity as their wants are unlimited and resources are limited. They may want something money cannot buy, such as time, respect, love, etc. Student A is right. With scarcity, we want more than we have, so we have to make choices to decide which wants to satisfy and which to give up. Student B is wrong. If there is no scarcity, then we can have all the things we want. There is no need to make choices. a.  False. Economics concerns how people use scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. How to get rich is not the main theme of economics. b.  False. Since our resources are always insufficient to satisfy all our wants, the problem of scarcity can never be eliminated. Economics cannot teach us how to eliminate scarcity. c.  True. Economics is about how we use scarce resources to satisfy unlimited human wants, it deals with how to utilise limited resources to satisfy human wants as much as possible.","@ID":6},{"#text":"What is economics? 1.3 Opportunity cost As discussed above, we cannot satisfy our unlimited wants with our limited resources. Therefore, we have to make choices to determine what wants to satisfy. As a result, we have to give up something. Referring to ‘Task 1.2’ again, if Jody chooses a smartphone, she gives up a tablet computer. In other words, making decisions involves a cost. In economics, we measure cost in terms of opportunity forgone. This is the concept of opportunity cost . 1 1 opportunity cost機會成本 2 option選項 3 forgone放棄 4 forsaken放棄 Fig. 1.3 Relationship between some basic concepts in economics Causes Problem Consequences Scarcity Opportunity cost Choice Unlimited wants Limited resources + Opportunity cost can be measured in terms of the highest-valued option forgone or its value. A Definition Opportunity cost, or simply cost, is the highest-valued option2 forgone3 (or the best alternative forsaken4 ). When we choose a particular option, we have to give up other options. But not all the options (or alternatives) forgone are considered the opportunity cost. Only the highest-valued option forgone is the opportunity cost. 1 7 Please refer to ‘Test yourself 1.4’ on p.11 for an illustration of this concept.","@ID":7}]}}
